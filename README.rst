FeersumNLU API Wrappers
***********************

(Note: This repo is currently being updated with more examples)

This git repo host Python and other language wrappers for the FeersumNLU RESTful HTTP API. There are also some curl examples of direct HTTP access. These wrappers are for version 2.0.1 of the HTTP API. 

The API wrappers are auto-generated from a Swagger spec of the API available at `<http://nlu.playground.feersum.io:8100/nlu/v2/swagger.json>`_

Overview
********

FeersumNLU provides Natural Language solutions for chat-based interactions, where messages from the end-user are especially short. Our product is also designed to be language-agnostic, which means it can be scaled to work with any language, even in markets where large bodies of labelled data do not exist. Our Natural Language Understanding models are developed locally, and can be modified to provide solutions for specialised industries like finance or health.

Features
********

FeersumNLU makes use of open-source building blocks like NLTK, sklearn, PyTorch and Duckling, as well as algorithms we've developed in-house. We build on all elements to support a growing list of local and international languages.

Current features include Natural Language FAQ's, detection of the user's intent and sentiment, information extraction, entity extraction, and text-based language identification.

You can play with FeersumNLU as a RESTful web service at nlu.playground.feersum.io:8100/nlu/v2. You'll need an authentication token to access the service, so email us at nlu@feersum.io and we'll send you a token to use. Some autogenerated API documentation is available at <http://nlu.playground.feersum.io:8100/nlu/v2>`_
